What is ExtLib ?
----------------

ExtLib is a set of additional useful functions and modules for OCaml.
Project page :
  https://github.com/ygrek/ocaml-extlib

People are encouraged to contribute and to report any bugs or problem
they might have with ExtLib by using github issues and pull requests.

Dependencies :
--------------

cppo - enables conditional compilation to ensure compatibility with various OCaml versions
ocamlfind >= 1.5.1 - provides bytes package

Installation :
--------------

Unzip or untar in any directory and run

  make minimal=1 build install

This will build and install bytecode and native libraries.
On bytecode-only architecture run

  make minimal=1 all install

`minimal=1` will exclude from build several modules (namely Unzip UChar UTF8) potentially
conflicting with other well established OCaml libraries. If your code is expecting to find
these modules in extlib - omit this parameter during build to produce the full library.

Usage :
-------

Generate and read the documentation.
